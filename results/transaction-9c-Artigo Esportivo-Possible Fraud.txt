### Recommendation for Transaction ID: "9c"

#### Recommendation:
**1. Engage Anti-Fraud Team:**  
Due to the system's classification of the transaction as "Possible Fraud" based on the unusually high amount ($1103.00) for a sporting item and the deviation from typical spending patterns, escalate this matter to the Anti-Fraud Team for immediate investigation. The team should analyze the details, transaction history, and any associated behavioral anomalies.

**2. Perform Manual Verification:**  
Simultaneously, a manual review of the transaction should be performed to cross-check the merchant, purchase details, and cardholder's spending trends. Verify if there are any prior transactions consistent with purchases from "Esporte C" or for similar high-value sporting goods.

**3. Notify Customer:**  
Once initial investigations are underway, notify the customer to verify the legitimacy of the transaction. Provide a secure channel for the customer to confirm or dispute the purchase. This step is critical to mitigate potential unauthorized charges or fraudulent account activity.

#### Classification of Fraud:
**Potential Type:**  
The fraud indicators suggest possible **Card-Not-Present Fraud** or **Account Takeover Fraud**. This is inferred from the following factors:
- Large transaction amount atypical for the account.
- High-value purchase for a potentially discretionary item.
- Location-specific anomaly (if this is inconsistent with prior spending behavior in Porto Alegre).

#### Conclusion:
Immediate action combining anti-fraud team escalation, transaction review, and customer notification is necessary to address the potential fraudulent activity effectively and safeguard customer assets.
